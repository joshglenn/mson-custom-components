# mson-custom-components 

This is a sample app that will get you started with creating custom mson components with custom mson-react UI rendering components.

[MSON](https://github.com/redgeoff/mson). 

This repo is built on top of the mson-getting-started app, but has added custom-component-rendering features.  

## Running the app

 - $ git clone https://github.com/joshglenn/mson-custom-components
 - $ cd mson-custom-components
 - $ yarn install
 - $ yarn start
 - Visit http://localhost:3000 in a web browser

Much of the app logic resides in [components.js](src/components.js). Look at what you get with just a few lines of MSON!

For instruction on how to create your own custom mson components, and how they work, start the app using the instructions above and read all about it (the instructs are a page in this app).

## create-react-app

Note: mson-getting-started uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with very few changes.
